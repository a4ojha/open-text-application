# OpenText Coding Test
This is my application for the Full Stack Developer Intern position.

1. Using the fewest lines of code in the language of your choice, display a triangle of 3x4. State any assumptions in the comments.
    > Bonus: create a second function that accepts any M x N, where M and N are positive integers, and display the triangle with the specified dimension.
    
    **Implementation**: [test1.py](https://github.com/a4ojha/open-text-application/blob/main/test1.py)


2. You are tasked to migrate a list of product information from one of the legacy platforms to a new platform. This is the page containing the product information: https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/products?trial=true. As a preparation task, in the language of your choice, write a parser to extract the product list with the following fields from the listing page into a JSON:
    -    Product Name
    -    Starting Letter, ex. "Adoption Readiness Tool" Ã  "A"
    -    Description
    -    Free Trial / Demo Request URL
    -    Support Link URL
    -    Community Link URL

    **Implementation**: [test2](https://github.com/a4ojha/open-text-application/blob/main/test2/parser.py)
